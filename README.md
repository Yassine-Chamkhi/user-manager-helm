# Helm Charts for GO-REST-API-USER-MANAGER
This repository contains the helm charts necessary to deploy the [GO REST API USER MANAGER](https://github.com/Yassine-Chamkhi/go-rest-api-user-manager) to run in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Description
The **user-manager** directory contains the templates and values. In each **"env-*"** directory is a copy of user-manager, which should be adapted to each deployment environment (namely dev, prod and test). They are all currently identical.
